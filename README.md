        - Unity builds your project and opens the generated Xcode workspace.
        - Note: If you use **Build Settingsâ€¦ > Build** to build your project, be sure to open the generated **\*.xcworkspace** workspace 
                file in Xcode, not the included **\*.xcodeproj** project file. Opening the project file will result in build errors.
