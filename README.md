### Step 1: Install Unity 
1. Recommended version: [LTS release 2017.4](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) or newer here: 
2. Minimum version: 5.6
	- Make sure **iOS Build Support** is selected during installation.
    
### Step 2: Configure your environment for iOS development
1. Refer to Unity's guide for [Getting started with iOS development](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/iphone-GettingStarted.html)

### Step 3: Download the Google VR SDK for Unity
1. Download the latest [**GoogleVRForUnity_\*.unitypackage**](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases)

### Step 4: Create a new Unity project and import the Google VR Unity package
1. Open Unity and create a new **3D project**
2. Select **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package**
3. Select the **GoogleVRForUnity_\*.unitypackage** file that was downloaded
4. In the **Importing Package** dialog, click **Import**
	- Accept any [API upgrades](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/APIUpdater.html) if prompted

### Step 5: Configure build settings and player settings
1. Select **File > Build Settings**
2. Select iOS and click **Switch Platform**
3. In the **Build Settings** window, click **Player Settings**
4. Configure the following player settings:
	- **Player Settings > Other Settings > Virtual Reality Supported**  -->  Enabled
	- **Player Settings > Other Settings > SDKs** --> Click + and select Cardboard
	- **Player Settings > Other Settings > Target minimum iOS version** --> 8.0 or higher

### Step 6: Preview the demo scene in Unity
1. In the Unity **Project** window, go to **Assets > Google VR > Demos > Scenes**. Open the **HelloVR** scene.
2. Press the **Play** button. In the **Game** view you should see a rendered demo scene.
	- **Note:** although the scene here is monoscopic, the rendering on your phone will be stereo.
3. Interact with the scene using simulation controls
    
### Step 7: Build and run the demo scene on your device
1. Connect your phoe to your computer using a USB cable
2. Select **File > Build and Run**
	- Unity builds your project and opens the generated Xcode workspace.
	- Note: If you use **Build Settingsâ€¦ > Build** to build your project, be sure to open the generated **\*.xcworkspace** workspace file in Xcode, not the included **\*.xcodeproj** project file. Opening the project file will result in build errors.
